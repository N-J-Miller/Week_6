## Intro to SQL

#### SQL, or Structured Query Language, is an ANSI standard language for working with relatonal databases. 

 Developed in 1974, this language has been in use for near half a century.
 SQL has enjoyed such long-lived popularity becuase of the following features:
 
 * Users can access data in the relational database management systems with SQL.
    
 * SQL allows users to describe the data.
    
 * Allows users to define the data in a database and manipulate that data.
    
 * Users can embed within other languages using SQL modules, libraries & pre-compilers.
    
 * With SQL, users can create and drop databases and tables, and also .
    
 * Easily allows users to set permissions on tables, procedures and views.

SQL works with Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS), examples include:
MySQL, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres and SQL Server.

#### RDMS are based on the relational model as introduced by E. F. Codd in 1970. 
* Because the data is relational, it is stored in table form, making retrieval and manipulation very efficient. 
* Tables are then made up of fields, columns, and rows.
* Null values -where fields are blank- can be easily handled with SQL in a RDMS.
* Data Integrity is managed on several different tiers of data organization.
* SQL constraints are used to manipulate data with a high degree of control.
* 'Normal Forms' are used to normalize data organization within RDMS, making them ideal for collaborative work.
